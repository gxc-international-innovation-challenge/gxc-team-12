## Challenge Statement

*How can municipalities, through digital solutions, motivate local companies towards climate protection, in times of crisis?*

## Problem Statement

CO₂ reduction is still a great challenge for cities and the stress of dealing with a crisis does not help the situation. Buildings and offices need to help become part of the solution in reducing CO₂ in order to alleviate the issue of climate change. One way this could be done is an increase in green space in and around the office and buildings in Munich. Unfortunately, implementing substantial changes through business can be difficult economically, and large businesses may not be willing to create change. Big business is the leader in greenhouse gas emission, which means that these businesses must change in order to improve the current state of CO2 in the atmosphere. There is much research corresponding green space with mental health (See (Engemann, 2019)(Roe, 2013)(Wolf, 2015) for example), that show that an increase in green space can reduce stress and even reduce the risks of developing psychological disorders. 

There needs to be an easy to implement and economical way for businesses, even in times of crisis, to implement more green spaces in and around their office or building. Therefore, we are looking to urge businesses to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions through the means of a digital solution.

## Our Solution

The implementation of green walls in the city of Munich could help contribute to the reduction of CO₂. In order to help achieve this, it is necessary to not only spread the word about green walls, but to also have a way to help people and businesses through the process of creating and building one. Our prototype of a green wall website combines all the information needed to design, build, and maintain a green wall. It also works as a community function, bringing people together who are interested in such a solution for their home or office. It also works to inspire people to learn more about the different kinds of green walls, share experiences, and give an extensive look at the variety of benefits that come with the construction of a green wall.
