## Challenge Statement

*How can municipalities, through digital solutions, motivate local companies towards climate protection, in times of crisis?*

## Problem Statement

CO₂ reduction is still a great challenge for cities and the stress of dealing with a crisis does not help the situation. Buildings and offices need to help become part of the solution in reducing CO₂ in order to alleviate the issue of climate change. One way this could be done is an increase in green space in and around the office and buildings in Munich. Unfortunately, implementing substantial changes through business can be difficult economically, and large businesses may not be willing to create change. Big business is the leader in greenhouse gas emission, which means that these businesses must change in order to improve the current state of CO2 in the atmosphere. There is much research corresponding green space with mental health (See (Engemann, 2019)(Roe, 2013)(Wolf, 2015) for example), that show that an increase in green space can reduce stress and even reduce the risks of developing psychological disorders. 

There needs to be an easy to implement and economical way for businesses, even in times of crisis, to implement more green spaces in and around their office or building. Therefore, we are looking to urge businesses to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions through the means of a digital solution.
